My name is Ran. I completed my PhD in industrial engineering at Texas A&M University where I pioneered the application of [active inference](https://direct.mit.edu/books/oa-monograph/5299/Active-InferenceThe-Free-Energy-Principle-in-Mind) and the [free energy principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_energy_principle) to human driving behavior modeling with my advisors and colleagues (see my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=gPoxkOUAAAAJ)). I am interested in human-computer interaction and decision making under uncertainty, which implies my interests in cognitive science, psychology, reinforcement learning, and Bayesian statistics.
