Welcome to LatentObservations! 

This blog is dedicated to a wide range of topics in data science, machine learning, optimization, cognitive science, human-computer interaction, and many others, which I consider to be not mainstream or obvious. In other words, these **observations** are **latent**, and thus the name of the blog. I hope the posts are as paradoxical and non-orthodox as the blog name and in the end a bit enlightening. 

The posts will be constantly updated, so don't stress out if there is any error. Please find my contact below if you like the posts, have comments, questions, suggestions, or simply want to chat and connect. 

Note: this blog represents my own opinions and unrelated to any professional affiliations I might be associated with.
