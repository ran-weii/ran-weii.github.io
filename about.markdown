Hi! My name is Ran. I am a PhD student in Human-Computer Interaction. I will use this blog to document my personal learning of machine learning, data science, optimization, and perhaps robotics. I intend these posts to be nonstandard - unlike your top Google search results, but useful when you feel like you couldn't find what you are looking for.
