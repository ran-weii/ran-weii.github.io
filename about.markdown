This site is the equivalence of my [Substack site](https://latentobservations.substack.com/) but offers a slightly better math reading experience. 

## Niche topics in ML and CogSci
LatentObservations aims to raise public awareness on niche topics in machine learning and cognitive science. Although the nicheness of a topic is completely determined by my weird research taste, currently it tends to be biased towards Bayesian approaches to ML and CogSci.

As an attest to the nicheness of the topics, the blog name LatentObservations was created as a contradiction on purpose: 
* In Bayesian methods observations are never latent. 
* Observed variables in Bayesian networks are by convention colored in gray, while latent variables are colored in white.

The intent here is to share observations that are not obvious or mainstream.
